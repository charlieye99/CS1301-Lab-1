    <h1> Choosing a Saxophone</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="bodytext">
    <p>The first thing you need to consider is what kind of saxophone you want to start with!
      Most players begin learning with the alto, but you can read below to find out what saxophone is right for you. </p>
    <p> An important detail to note is the different models of saxophones you can buy, ranging from beginner to intermediate to professional.
      If you're just starting off, a beginner saxophone is the best option for you!</p>
    <p>The advantages of buying intermediate/professional models are durability, quality of sound, and obviously aesthetics.</p>
    <p>Although you can buy saxophones online, your best bet is to find a local store and try playing them before you buy!
      Each different model of saxophone has subtle but sometimes drastic differences in sound and feel.</p>
    <p>If you're really looking to save money, you can buy a used saxophone. If you make sure you test them before purchase, you can save some serious money.</p>
    <p>You can click any of the images on the left to browse different models!</p>

      <td class="Type"><h2>Soprano</h2></td>
      <td class="Details"><p>The soprano is the highest pitched and smallest of the saxophones.
      Although it tends to be cheaper, it is hard to master because of these qualities, as it is hard to control the higher register.</p></td>
      <td class="Usage"><p>The soprano finds its place in orchestras and classical music, because of its rich tone in the higher registers, but is sometimes played in jazz.</p></td>
